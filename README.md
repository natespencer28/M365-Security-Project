## 🚀 Project Update: Building a Secure Microsoft 365 Tenant from Scratch

As many of you know, I was impacted by recent tech layoffs and am now seeking my next opportunity as a **#M365SecurityEngineer** or a similar role.  

Instead of just applying through the ATS void, I’m taking a different approach — building out a **secure Microsoft 365 tenant from scratch** over the next **20–30 days**, following **CIS Benchmarks** and **real-world security best practices**.  

I’ll be documenting everything in a **GitHub repository**, showcasing configurations, lessons learned, and what works (or doesn’t) in production environments.  

My goal is to foster a **collaborative dialogue** around Microsoft 365 security — gathering feedback, sharing insights, and improving together.

### 🧩 Focus Areas
- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)  
- Intune & Device Compliance  
- Microsoft Defender Suite (MDE, MDO, MDCA)  
- Conditional Access & Zero Trust  
- CIS Benchmark Alignment for M365

### 💬 Let’s Collaborate
If you’ve implemented CIS controls or security hardening in your own M365 environment, I’d love to hear what’s worked for you — and what hasn’t.  

Feel free to open a **Discussion**, drop a **Pull Request**, or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/nathaniel-spencer-133903153).
